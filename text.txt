   Lviv Polytechnic National University (LPNU) is the oldest technical higher education institution in Ukraine and Eastern Europe. Its history began in 1816 with the foundation of its forerunner, the Lviv Technical Academy, one of the earliest colleges of technology in Europe and the first in the Ukrainian lands. Since then, the institution has evolved from early technical schools into a comprehensive research university with a strong international profile.
